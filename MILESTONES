Here is a general outline of the milestones we'd like to make:

  CS Milestone 1: Basic python program that will attempt to read
               keyboard input and check a static list of numbers.

  CS Milestone 2: Implement a cron job or some sort of retreival 
               of a list of correct numbers from some remote source.

               -----------------------------------------------

  EE Milestone 1: Figure out how to interface with the PI's components
                  and make some sort of indication upon success. Could
                  possibly be lighting up something, or making a sound.

  EE Milestone 2: Successfully interface with a card reader, if one
                  is available to us. 

  EE Milestone 3: Implement a slightly more complex form of 
                  success notification, be it a lock release or some
                  mechanical movement.
