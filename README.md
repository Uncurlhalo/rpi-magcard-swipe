rpi-magcard-swipe
=================

Code for use with a Raspberry Pi to provide limited acces to a room or safe with a magstrip reader and USB relay switch.

UNIX/Linux systems:
	Place all the files in the same directory. The python was written in Python 3 but may work with Python 2 versions.
	cd to the files location and run with 'python3 ./cardSwipe.py'. If you do not have python3 try with python 2.
	It likely will still work.
Windows and Mac:
	Haven't tested.
